# Offline Functionality Implementation

## Overview
The app now supports full offline functionality for creating, editing, deleting, and managing notes and reminders when there is no internet connection. All data is stored locally in a SQLite database and synchronized with the server when connectivity is restored.

## How It Works

### Offline Detection
- Uses `ConnectivityService` to monitor internet connectivity in real-time
- Automatically switches between online and offline modes

### Offline Features

#### 1. **Text-Only Notes and Reminders**
When offline, the app will:
- Create notes and reminders as text-only (no voice transcription)
- Store data in local SQLite database
- Mark items as "unsynced" for later synchronization

#### 2. **Full CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: New notes/reminders saved locally with `pending_action: 'create'`
- **Read**: Display all local notes/reminders from database
- **Update**: Edit existing notes/reminders, marked as `pending_action: 'update'`
- **Delete**: Soft delete with `pending_action: 'delete'`

#### 3. **Note Pinning**
- Pin/unpin notes while offline
- Changes tracked for sync when online

#### 4. **Automatic Background Sync**
- Monitors connectivity changes
- Automatically syncs when internet is restored
- Clears local database after successful sync

## Database Schema

### Notes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE notes(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  server_id TEXT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_reminder INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_pinned INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_synced INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_deleted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  pending_action TEXT
)
```

### Reminders Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE reminders(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  server_id TEXT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  time TEXT NOT NULL,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  runtime TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  priority TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium',
  is_synced INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_deleted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  pending_action TEXT
)
```

## Key Services

### 1. OfflineService
- Main service for offline operations
- Handles CRUD operations on local database
- Listens for connectivity changes and triggers sync

### 2. SyncService  
- Manages synchronization with server
- Handles pending actions (create, update, delete)
- Clears local data after successful sync

### 3. DataService
- Unified data access layer
- Returns online data when connected, offline data when not
- Seamless switching between modes

### 4. ConnectivityService
- Monitors internet connectivity
- Provides real-time connectivity status
- Triggers sync when connection is restored

## User Experience

### Online Mode
- Full functionality with server sync
- Voice transcription available
- Real-time data updates

### Offline Mode  
- Text-only note/reminder creation
- Local storage with full CRUD operations
- Visual indicators for offline status
- Automatic sync when connection restored

### Sync Process
1. Detect internet connectivity
2. Upload pending local changes to server
3. Handle conflicts (if any)
4. Clear local database after successful sync
5. Resume normal online operation

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `lib/services/offline_service.dart` - Main offline functionality service
- `lib/models/local/local_note.dart` - Local note model (already existed)
- `lib/models/local/local_reminder.dart` - Local reminder model (already existed)

### Modified Files:
- `lib/services/sync_service.dart` - Enhanced with proper sync logic
- `lib/services/database_helper.dart` - Database operations (already had good implementation)
- `lib/services/connectivity_service.dart` - Connectivity monitoring (already existed)
- `lib/services/data_service.dart` - Unified data layer (already had offline support)
- `lib/ui/views/voice/viewmodel/text_input_viewmodel.dart` - Offline note/reminder creation
- `lib/ui/views/voice/viewmodel/home_listing_viewmodel.dart` - Offline operations support
- `lib/app/app.dart` - Service registration
- `lib/main.dart` - Service initialization

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. **Creating Offline Notes**: When offline, create text notes normally - they'll be saved locally
2. **Managing Notes**: Edit, delete, and pin notes as usual while offline
3. **Automatic Sync**: Notes will automatically sync when internet returns
4. **Status Indication**: App shows connection status and sync progress

### For Developers:
1. All offline logic is encapsulated in services
2. UI components automatically handle online/offline modes
3. Database operations are abstracted through services
4. Sync happens transparently in background

## Benefits
- ✅ Full functionality without internet
- ✅ No data loss during offline periods  
- ✅ Seamless online/offline transitions
- ✅ Automatic background synchronization
- ✅ Efficient local storage with proper cleanup
- ✅ Consistent user experience across connection states
